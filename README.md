# Case Study with Python: Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office

## Project Description

In this project, I applied Python skills to solve a real-world data science problem. I pressed “watch next episode” to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.
I performed critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots you create of the data.

#### For this project I used the Python in order to manipulate data frames. I used the Pandas package, Matlibplot, and Numpy.
